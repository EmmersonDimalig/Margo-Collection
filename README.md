# Margo-Collection
Overview: This business is a solo-operated venture specializing in handmade crochet flowers, with sales conducted exclusively through Facebook. We selected this business to explore the common challenges faced by small-scale Facebook sellers, particularly around manual order management. Currently, customers must wait for the seller to be online to place an order, which often leads to missed sales opportunities and inefficiencies. By addressing these pain points, we aim to design a system that streamlines order processing, automates key tasks, and enables sellers to save time, improve customer experience, and grow their business more effectively.
